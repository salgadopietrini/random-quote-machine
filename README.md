# random-quote-machine is a simple react app to generate a random quote

My first react app. Generates and lets you share a random quote, while also changing the background when the button is clicked.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/salgadopietrini/random-quote-machine.git
```

2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.
